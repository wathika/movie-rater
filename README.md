# movie-rater
A program that will keep track of my movie ratings.


It'll do one of four things: 
**add** a new movie to a hash, 
**update** the rating for an existing movie, 
**display** the movies and ratings that are already in the hash, 
or **delete** a movie from the hash. 
If it doesn't receive one of those four commands, the program will output some kind of error message.
